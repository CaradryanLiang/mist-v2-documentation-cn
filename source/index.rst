Welcome to Mist-V2 Documentation
======================================

Mist is a powerful image preprocessing tool preventing image mimicry by AI-for-Art applications, for example, 
Stable Diffusion and NovelAI. By adding watermarks to the images, Mist renders them unrecognizable and inimitable 
for AI-for-Art applications.


Currently, Mist has been successfully tested against Stable Diffusion, including its textual inversion and 
Dreambooth features, as well as NovelAI, and scenario.gg. Moreover, Mist has shown considerate robustness 
against common watermark purification methods, such as screenshotting, cropping, and resizing.


We have open-sourced Mist and are committed to continuously maintaining and enhancing Mist. 
We hope to foster a community for users, developers and anyone else who are interested in improving Mist's 
functions, as well as discussing technical, moral and legal issues related to AI-for-Art applications, 
and other interesting topics associated with the rapidly evolving field of AI. See our 
`Homepage`_ to join us!
